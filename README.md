## Introduction
The primary function of this Python code is to analyze weather data from a CSV file and predict future weather conditions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The results are then visualized using matplotlib.

## Data Source
- **CSV File**: `L A_Weather.csv` 
## Libraries Used
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: `os` , `numpy` , `pandas` , `sklearn` 
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: `tensorflow` , `keras` 
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib` 
## Workflow
1. **Loading the CSV file**
2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
3. **Training the Neural Network**
4. **Predicting Weather**
5. **Visualizing the Results**
## Data Preprocessing
Describe the steps taken to preprocess and clean the data. Include any specific techniques or transformations applied to the dataset.

## Model Training
Detail the process of training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Include information about the architecture of the neural network, the training parameters, and any validation techniques used.

## Prediction
Explain how the trained model is used to predict weather conditions. Include any post-processing steps applied to the predictions.

## Visualization
Describe how the results are visualized using matplotlib. Include examples of the types of plots generated and their significance.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and the effectiveness of the neural network in predicting weather conditions. Discuss any potential improvements or future work.
